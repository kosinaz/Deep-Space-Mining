# Deep Space Mining

3-4 resource-demanding risky choices (Oregon Trail, FTL)

The toolmaker tool and the personal refinery are universal, initially given and automatic, because they are not related to the mining procedure, the discovery and extraction of ores.

Every block contains several resources. The texture of the block and its position related to other both different and similar blocks give clues about its ingredients and their quantity. Some ingredients might appear more times on the texture but others might be more dense or more valuable. The texture of the block might look the same as other blocks, but the shape and quantity of the same blocks around it reveal hidden ingredients. Because of this, finding one block of an ore vein is almost never enough to properly determine its contents and choose the best fitting extraction tool for it. Usually a significant part of the ore formation needs to be explored before the mining can be started. 

Every mining method extracts only one type of ore, and wastes every other one in that block. Every ore demands a specific extraction tool that contains a well-refined combination of 3-4 materials to maximize its efficiency. All other materials have a neutral or a negative effect on the ore. A mining tool made from the wrong materials can break immediately, if the block contains too many incompatible ores. If the materials are right, but their ratio is not, the tool will mine the ores close to the minimum amount. Some blocks can contain even 9-10 different ores, so it is impossible to mine them with a tool made out of any combination of 5-6 materials without losing a high amount of its durability or even breaking it. Only some very rare ores make the mining of these blocks worth it. There are some unstable ores that can destroy the tool, the block, and even the nearby blocks if they got mined with the incorrect tool. If a block contains more than one unstable ores, it means sudden death in almost every cases.

Ores are spread across the universe widely. The close ones can be located and identified precisely and easily, but the further an ore is, the harder it becomes to find out what it is. Still, there is always at least one clue to find every ore. These clues are based on the texture of the containing areas and the distance of neighboring area types. Visiting the distant areas can be very resource demanding, that usually means some suitable resource types have to be mined first. If those can be found closer, but still too far to reach, the list of required resources will grow quickly.

Planets hold an enormous amount of resources, but hauling them into space is very resource demanding, because of gravity. Asteroids hold a lot less resources, but harvesting them hasn’t got any additional cost.

In the beginning every miner has a small set of randomly chosen ores, tools, and knowledge based on the ores that can be found around their randomly selected start location. With that the miner should be able to completely explore the whole procedurally generated universe and mine every block of it without any gameplay related random element that would make its ingredients indeterminable based on all the previous information the miner can gather about it.

# Beyond Starmade

## Issue

The player starts with super cheap ship core and enough credits to build a small fighter right at the beginning and start hunting pirates. There is no need for teamwork, and there isn’t any real progress that offers the satisfaction of owning and maintaining a whole ship as its captain.

## Solution

With more expensive ship parts and an ultra expensive, multi-purpose, hard to build ship core, the players’ only way to have their own ships is to be crew members of others’ ships. Because that way they are able to participate in missions, reach different planets, hunt pirates or raid traders, and earn their part of the loot that helps them to have their own ship later on.
So instead of an advanced shop, all the players should start in a large trade station, where they can meet each other, get a job in the local factory, become a gunner on a patrol ship around the station, or in a wealthier player’s crew.

## Experiences

A small miner fleet found my planet and the fighters attacked my base without warning. I had seconds to grab all the stuff I wanted to save and jump into my unfinished unarmed ship. I was able to escape but I was unable to stop. There were no generators in my ship yet and I used all my initial energy to gain the escape velocity so I was unable to use my thrusters to slow down. I quickly realized that I have to build the generators literally on the fly. It was quite exciting building the generator block by block while my ship was rushing into the unknown space of stars and pirate stations. Later when I finished my ship I went back to my planet and I even found some of my stuff unharmed.

### Pros

* Random encounters with similar motivations
* Accidents and unexpected events caused by bad but not fatal decisions
* Problem-solving on the fly with an uncertain but imminent deadline

### Cons

* Quiet AI, no warning or friendly welcome

Mining for raw materials and manufacturing them are key features of the game, still, these are the weakest points of it.
There are too few raw materials and while there are a lot of blocks to make the challenge is not to manufacture them but to farm enough materials for them. Which is unchallenging and time-consuming. Its only purpose is to delay the building. It is missing meaningful choices and the only challenge of the intelligence is to remember which planet part or asteroid provides which materials.

# Through Lenses

Lens 1:
What emotions would I like my player to experience? Why?

Anticipation, fear, joy, surprise, because these are the emotions a miner would feel during searching for and mining out never known ores.

What emotions are players (including me) having when they play now? Why?

How can I bridge the gap between the emotions players are having and the emotions I’d like them to have?
